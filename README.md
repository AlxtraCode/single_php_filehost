# Single .php Filehost
Simple .php script, mainly for sharing random files with people via curl. (and thus in an easily scriptable way)

You can pretty much just slap this on any webserver with apache2 and rewrite enabled on it, and it should work. The .htaccess is just what I use, and could possibly need a tweak, depending on your situation. Everything else, including configuration, is explained in the code. (but should be pretty self-explanatory anyway)
